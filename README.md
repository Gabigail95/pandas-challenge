Analysis of district-wide standardized test results

# PyCity Schools Analysis

# In this analysis, we will review the data for a School District, focusing on the standardized test scores while taking specific metrics into account, such as the type of school, grde level, budgets, and student count, among others.

# After analyzing the data, one key result was that the schools with a higher budget did not perform better than those with a lower budget. Instead, three out of the four schools with a budget over 2 million dollars were among the 5 lowest performing schools. However, those schools with the highest budgets also had a higher number of students. Of the 15 schools within the district, only 8 had an overall passing rate above 70%. Overall, students scored a lot better with reading over math. All school performed with a passing rate for the reading percentage score, but only 8 schools passed for math. 

# Please review below summaries for a the detailed findings.
